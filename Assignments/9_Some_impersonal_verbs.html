	<h2>Some Impersonal Verbs</h2>
	
	<div class="block">
		<p>When we refer to an impersonal verb in Latin, we are referring to a verb in the third person singular which has, as its subject, an infinitive or accusative and infinitive construction. When translated into English, however, an impersonal phrase is signaled by the use of the pronoun “it” (with no referent) as the subject of the impersonal phrase.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Cōnstābat</span> tamen esse deōs.</p>
			<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">It was agreed</span> however that they were gods.”</p>
			<p class="indent2">(literally, “That they were gods <span class="underline">was agreed</span>.”)</p>

		<p>When the Latin subject is expressed by an infinitive without a subject accusative, the subject is conveyed in English as an infinitive. When the subject is expressed by an accusative and infinitive construction, the subject is usually conveyed in English with a subordinate clause introduced by the subordinating conjuction “that”.</p>
		<p class="indent">Nōbīs nōn licet <span class="underline">hoc</span> <span class="underline">dīcere</span>. “It is not permitted for us <span class="underline">to say</span> <span class="underline">this</span>.”</p>
		<p class="indent">Appārēbat <span class="underline">omne discrīmen</span> <span class="underline">adesse</span>. “It seemed that <span class="underline">a general crisis</span> <span class="underline">was at hand</span>.”</p>

		<p>The use of the Latin infinitive in impersonal constructions follows the usual rules of tense for infinitives in indirect statements, with the present infinitive indicating time same as the impersonal verb, the perfect infinitive indicating time prior, and the future infinitive used to depict subsequent time.</p>

		<p>Also, like in indirect statements, infinitive or accusative and infinitive used in this way can have dependent elements (a direct object, a prepositional phrase, etc.) all of which make up the subject of the impersonal verb.</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Nihil ex tantā urbe relinquī</span> superīs placet.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“It is pleasing to the gods <span class="underline">that nothing from so great a city to remain</span>.”</p>

		<p>The meaning of each impersonal verb is often specific to its impersonal usage. In this lesson, one impersonal meaning is given for each verb, though other suitable meanings may also be found by consulting a lexicon.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>Some impersonal verbs include: appāret (“it appears”), cōnstat (“it is agreed”), liquet (“it is clear”), praestat (“it is preferable”), vidētur (“it seems”). </p>
		<p class="indent">Pompēium mihi amīcissimum esse <span class="underline">cōnstat</span>.</p>
			<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">It is agreed</span> that Pompeius is most loyal to me.”</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Appāruit</span> eī senātum nōn taedēre bellī. </p>
			<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">It appeared</span> to him that the Senate did not tire of war.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">	
		<p>Some impersonal verbs are transitive and so require a direct object, and these verbs include: decet or dēdecet (“it befits”), dēlectat (“it delights”), iuvat (“it pleases”), oportet (“it behooves”).</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Ōrātōrem</span> īrascī minimē <span class="underline">decet</span>. “<span class="underline">It</span> least of all <span class="underline">befits</span> <span class="underline">the orator</span> to be angry.”</p>
		<p class="indent">Quid nōs velle oportet? “What does it behoove us to want?”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>Other impersonal verbs may instead have an accompanying dative (sometimes called the dative of the person concerned) indicating the person (or thing) for whom the verbal action is of a relevant interest. Impersonal verbs which may have an accompanying dative of the person concerned include: condūcit (“it profits”), expedit (“it is useful”), licet (“it is permitted”), obest (“it is harmful”), prōdest (“it benefits”), placet (“it is pleasing”), displicet (“it is displeasing”) libet (“it is pleasing”), vidētur (“it seems best”).</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Prōfuit</span> <span class="underline">multīs</span> capī. “<span class="underline">It has benefited</span> <span class="underline">many</span> to be capture.”</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Liceat</span> <span class="underline">mihi</span> vēra referre. “<span class="underline">May it be permitted</span> <span class="underline">to me</span> to report true words.”</p>
		<p>The dative with placet and displicet is often translated into English as if it were the subject of the impersonal verb. </p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Mihi</span> <span class="underline">placet</span> temptāre animī tuī firmitātem. “<span class="underline">I</span> <span class="underline">like</span> to test the strength of your mind.” </p>
		<p class="indent2">(literally, “To test the strength of your mind <span class="underline">is pleasing</span> <span class="underline">to me</span>.”)</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>In addition to these verbs, a neuter singular adjective paired with est can take an infinitive or accusative and infinitive as its subject. In some cases, this construction may be accompanied by a dative of the person concerned. Some such phrases include: difficile est (“it is difficult”), melius est (“it is better”), dulce ese (“it is sweet”), certum est (“it is determined” or more often “X has decided” where X is expressed by the dative).</p>
		<p class="indent">Nātūram ipsam dēfīnīre <span class="underline">difficile est</span>. “<span class="underline">It is difficult</span> to define nature itself.”</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Melius est</span> vitia vitiīs nōn oppōnere. “<span class="underline">It is better</span> not to combat vices with vices.”</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Certum est</span> <span class="underline">Pompēiō</span> esse in Hispāniā. “<span class="underline">Pompey</span> <span class="underline">has decided</span> to be in Spain.”</p>
		<p class="indent2">(literally, “<span class="underline">It is determined</span> <span class="underline">for Pompey</span> to be in Spain.”)</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>An infinitive or accusative and infinitive construction and a dative of the person concerned can also be found with some other periphrastic phrases, including: fās est (“it is right”), nefās est (“it is impious”), necesse est (“it is necessary”), opus est (“there is need”).</p>
		<p class="indent">Vōs fallere mihi nōn <span class="underline">fās est</span>. “<span class="underline">It is</span> not <span class="underline">right</span> for you to deceive me.”</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Nefās est</span> tendere adversus auctōritātem senātūs.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">It is impiou</span>s to strive against the authority of the Senate.”</p>
		<p class="indent">Hoc fierī <span class="underline">opus est</span>. “<span class="underline">There is a need</span> for this to happen.”</p>
		<p>Opus est, however, commonly takes a lone ablative object (ie. <span class="underline">Exhortātiōne</span> nōn opus est. “There is no need <span class="underline">for exhortation</span>.”).</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Some additional notes</h2>
	<div class="block">
		<p>An indirect question may also appear as the subject of an impersonal verb.</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Priscī Tarquiniī fīlius nepōsne fuerit</span> parum liquet.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“It is insufficient clear <span class="underline">whether he was the son or grandson of Tarquinius Priscus</span>.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>An ut clause and a subjunctive verb may also appear as the subject of some impersonal verbs.</p>
		<p class="indent">Opus est <span class="underline">ut hīc aliquot diēs maneā</span>s. </p>
		<p class="indent2">“There is need <span class="underline">for you to remain here for several days</span>.”</p>
	</div>	
	<div class="block">
		<p>The subject of some impersonal verbs (including oportet, licet, necesse est, and opus est) may also be expressed by a lone subjunctive verb.</p>
		<p class="indent">Necesse est <span class="underline">sciās</span>. “It is necessary <span class="underline">that you know</span>.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>Certain neuter adjectives accompanying est instead have a noun clause of result as the subject, including reliquum est, cōnsequēns est, etc. (see Lesson 17)</p>
