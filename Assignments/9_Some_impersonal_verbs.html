	<h2>Some impersonal verbs</h2>
	
	<div class="block">
		<p>When we refer to an impersonal verb in Latin, we are referring to a verb in the third person singular which has, as its subject, an infinitive or accusative and infinitive construction (or a comparable construction, as covered in the additional notes). When translated into English, however, an impersonal phrase is signaled by the use of the pronoun “it” (with no referent) as the subject of the impersonal phrase.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Cōnstābat</span> esse deōs.</p>
			<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">It was agreed</span> that they were gods.”</p>
			<p class="indent2">(literally, “That they were gods <span class="underline">was agreed</span>.”)</p>

		<p>When the subject is expressed by an infinitive without a subject accusative, it is generally translated into English using an English infinitive.</p>
			<p class="indent">Nōbīs nōn licet <span class="underline">hoc</span> <span class="underline">dīcere</span>. “It is not permitted for us <span class="underline">to say</span> <span class="underline">this</span>.”</p>	
		<p>When the subject is expressed by an accusative and infinitive construction, it is generally translated into English using a subordinate clause introduced by the conjunction “that”.</p>
		<p class="indent">Nōbīs nōn licet <span class="underline">hoc</span> <span class="underline">dīcere</span>. “It is not permitted for us <span class="underline">to say</span> <span class="underline">this</span>.”</p>
		<p class="indent">Appārēbat <span class="underline">omne discrīmen</span> <span class="underline">adesse</span>. “It seemed that <span class="underline">a general crisis</span> <span class="underline">was at hand</span>.”</p>

		<p>The use of the Latin infinitive in impersonal constructions follows the usual rules of tense for infinitives in indirect statements, with the present infinitive indicating time same as the impersonal verb, the perfect infinitive indicating time prior, and the future infinitive used to depict subsequent time.</p>

		<p>Also, like in indirect statements, infinitive or accusative and infinitive used in this way can have dependent elements (a direct object, a prepositional phrase, etc.) all of which make up the subject of the impersonal verb.</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Nihil ex tantā urbe relinquī</span> superīs placet.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“It is pleasing to the gods <span class="underline">that nothing from so great a city to remain</span>.”</p>

		<p>The meaning of each impersonal verb is often specific to its impersonal usage. In this lesson, one impersonal meaning is given for each verb, though other suitable meanings may also be found by consulting a lexicon.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>Some impersonal verbs include: <strong>appāret</strong> (“it appears”), <strong>cōnstat</strong> (“it is agreed”), <strong>liquet</strong> (“it is clear”), <strong>praestat</strong> (“it is preferable”).</p>
		<p class="indent">Pompeium mihi amīcissimum esse <span class="underline">cōnstat</span>.</p>
			<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">It is agreed</span> that Pompeius is most loyal to me.”</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Appāruit</span> eī senātum nōn taedēre bellī. </p>
			<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">It appeared</span> to him that the Senate did not tire of war.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">	
		<p>Some verbs, when used impersonally, usually have only an infinitive as their subject (not an accusative and infinitive) and also may have an accusative direct object (sometimes called the accusative of the person affected). These verbs include: <strong>decet</strong> or <strong>dēdecet</strong> (“it befits”), <strong>dēlectat</strong> (“it delights”), <strong>iuvat</strong> (“it pleases”), <strong>oportet</strong> (“it behooves”). </p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Ōrātōrem</span> īrascī minimē <span class="underline">decet</span>. “<span class="underline">It</span> least of all <span class="underline">befits</span> <span class="underline">the orator</span> to be angry.”</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Mē</span> potius nescīre <span class="underline">iuvābat</span>. “<span class="underline">It pleased</span> <span class="underline">me</span> more not to know.”</p>
		<p>The accusative object of oportet is often translated into English as if it were the subject of the verb, with oportet then translated as either “ought” or “must”.</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Mē</span> ad vōs venīre <span class="underline">oportet</span>. “<span class="underline">I</span> <span class="underline">must</span> come to you.” </p>
			<p class="indent2">(literally, “<span class="underline">It behooves</span> <span class="underline">me</span> to come to you.”)</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>Some verbs when used impersonally have either an infinitive or an accusative and infinitive as their subject and may also have an accompanying dative (sometimes called the dative of the person concerned) indicating the person (or thing) for whom the verbal action is of a relevant interest. Impersonal verbs which may have an accompanying dative of the person concerned include: <strong>condūcit</strong> (“it serves... well"), <strong>expedit</strong> (“it is useful”), <strong>licet</strong> (“it is permitted”), <strong>obest</strong> (“it is harmful”), <strong>prōdest</strong> (“it benefits”), <strong>placet</strong> (“it is pleasing”), <strong>displicet</strong> (“it is displeasing”) <strong>libet</strong> (“it is pleasing”), <strong>vidētur</strong> (“it seems best”).</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Prōfuit</span> <span class="underline">multīs</span> capī. “<span class="underline">It has benefited</span> <span class="underline">many</span> to be capture.”</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Liceat</span> <span class="underline">mihi</span> vēra referre. “<span class="underline">May it be permitted</span> <span class="underline">to me</span> to report true words.”</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Patriae</span> <span class="underline">condūcit</span> habēre cīvēs piōs in parentēs.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">It serves</span> <span class="underline">the country</span> <span class="underline">well</span> to posses citizens dutiful toward their parents.”</p>
		<p>The dative with placet and displicet is often translated into English as if it were the subject of the verb, with placet translated as “like” and displicet translated as “dislike”.</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Mihi</span> <span class="underline">placet</span> temptāre animī tuī firmitātem. “<span class="underline">I</span> <span class="underline">like</span> to test the strength of your mind.” </p>
		<p class="indent2">(literally, “To test the strength of your mind <span class="underline">is pleasing</span> <span class="underline">to me</span>.”)</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>In addition to these verbs, a neuter singular adjective paired with est can take an infinitive or accusative and infinitive as its subject. In some cases, these phrases may be accompanied by a dative of the person concerned. Some such phrases include: <strong>difficile est</strong> (“it is difficult”), <strong>melius est</strong> (“it is better”), <strong>dulce est</strong> (“it is sweet”), <strong>certum est</strong> (“it is determined” or more often “X has decided” where X is a person expressed by the dative).</p>
		<p class="indent">Nātūram ipsam dēfīnīre <span class="underline">difficile est</span>. “<span class="underline">It is difficult</span> to define nature itself.”</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Melius est</span> vitia vitiīs nōn oppōnere. “<span class="underline">It is better</span> not to combat vices with vices.”</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Certum est</span> <span class="underline">Pompeiō</span> esse in Hispāniā. “<span class="underline">Pompey</span> <span class="underline">has decided</span> to be in Spain.”</p>
		<p class="indent2">(literally, “<span class="underline">It is determined</span> <span class="underline">for Pompey</span> to be in Spain.”)</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>An infinitive or accusative and infinitive construction can express the subject with some other periphrastic phrases, including: <strong>fās est</strong> (“it is right”), <strong>nefās est</strong> (“it is impious”), <strong>necesse est</strong> (“it is necessary”), <strong>opus est</strong> (“there is need”). These periphrastic phrases may be accompanied by a dative of the person concerned.</p>
		<p class="indent">Vōs fallere mihi nōn <span class="underline">fās est</span>. “<span class="underline">It is</span> not <span class="underline">right</span> for you to deceive me.”</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Nefās est</span> tendere adversus auctōritātem senātūs.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">It is impious</span> to strive against the authority of the Senate.”</p>
		<p class="indent">Hoc fierī <span class="underline">opus est</span>. “<span class="underline">There is a need</span> for this to happen.”</p>
		<p>Opus est, however, commonly takes a lone ablative object (ie. <span class="underline">Exhortātiōne</span> nōn opus est. “There is no need <span class="underline">for exhortation</span>.”).</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Some additional notes</h2>
	<div class="block">
		<p>Other subjects found with impersonal verbs sometimes include: a neuter singular pronoun, an indirect question, or a ut clause with a subjunctive verb.</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Hoc</span> maximē reī pūblicae condūcit. “<span class="underline">This</span> serves the Republic especially well.”.</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Priscī Tarquiniī fīlius nepōsne fuerit</span> parum liquet.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“It is insufficient clear <span class="underline">whether he was the son or grandson of Tarquinius Priscus</span>.”</p>
		<p class="indent">Opus est <span class="underline">ut hīc aliquot diēs maneās</span>.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“There is need <span class="underline">for you to remain here for several days</span>.”</p>
		<p>The subject of certain impersonal verbs (in particular oportet, licet, necesse est, and opus est) is frequently expressed lone subjunctive verb..</p>
		<p class="indent">Necesse est <span class="underline">sciās</span>. “It is necessary <span class="underline">that you know</span>.”</p>
		<p class="indent">Rectius <span class="underline">vivat</span> oportet. “It is necessary <span class="underline">for him to live</span> rightly.”</p>
			<p class="indent2">or "<span class="underline">He</span> must <span class="underline">live</span> rightly.”</p>
		<p>Certain neuter singular adjectives accompanying est instead have a noun clause of result as the subject, including reliquum est, cōnsequēns est, etc. (see Lesson 17).</p>
