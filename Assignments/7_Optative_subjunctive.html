title: Assignment 7 Optative subjunctives
description: Assignment 7 provides an overview of the use of the subjunctive to express exclamatory wishes in independent clauses.
---

	<h2>Optative subjunctives</h2>
	
	<div class="block">
		<p>The independent subjunctive, a use often termed the optative subjunctive, may be used to express what one would like to happen or wishes would have occurred in the past. In particular, the optative subjunctive expresses an exclamatory wish (ie. Valeās! “May you fare well!”) as opposed to a declarative statement describing the content of one’s desires (ie. Volō tē valēre! “I want you to fare well.”).</p>

		<p>The optative Subjunctive is frequently negated by <strong>nē</strong>, sometimes by <strong>nōn</strong>.</p>

		<p>A wish for the future is expressed by a present tense subjunctive. It is generally translated into English by placing the word “may” before the subject of the exclamation.</p>
			
			<p class="indent">Meī cīvēs <span class="underline">valeant</span>! “<span class="underline">May</span> my fellow citizens <span class="underline">fare well</span>!”</p>

			<p>A present subjunctive expressing a wish is often accompanied by the particle <strong>utinam</strong>. This particle signals the optative force of the verb and requires no additional translation in English.</p>
			
			<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Utinam</span> animum ab īrā revocēs! “May you recall your mind from anger!”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Utinam</span> <span class="underline">nē</span> haec <span class="underline">experiāris</span>! “<span class="underline">May you</span> <span class="underline">not</span> <span class="underline">experience</span> these things!”</p>
	</div>

	<div class="block">
		<p>Wishes expressed by past tenses of the subjunctive indicate that the wish is unfulfilled. Unfulfilled wishes are regularly accompanied by utinam and are best translated into English with the subject preceded by the phrase “would that”.</p>

		<p>An unfulfilled wish for something to be true in the present is expressed by the imperfect subjunctive. </p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Utinam</span> Aenēās ipse <span class="underline">adesset</span>! “<span class="underline">Would that</span> Aeneas himself <span class="underline">were present</span>!”</p>
		<p class="indent">Illud <span class="underline">utinam</span> <span class="underline">nē</span> vērē <span class="underline">scrīberem</span>! “<span class="underline">Would that</span> <span class="underline">I did</span> <span class="underline">not</span> <span class="underline">write</span> this truthfully!”</p>

		<p>An unfulfilled wish for something to have happened in the past is expressed by the pluperfect subjunctive.</p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Utinam</span> hīs officiīs contenta <span class="underline">fuissem</span>! </p>
		<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">Would that I had been contented</span> with these duties!”</p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Utinam</span> moderatius secundās rēs ferre <span class="underline">potuisset</span>!</p>
		<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">Would that he had been able to bear</span> favorable things more moderately!”</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Some additional notes</h2>
	<div class="block">
		<p>In earlier Latin, an unfulfilled wish in the past is sometimes expressed by the imperfect subjunctive (see Woodcock §115).</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>The perfect subjunctive appears rarely with optative force. However, when it is used, the perfect subjunctive represents a possible wish in reference to a past action.</p>
		<p class="indent">Tuā pāce <span class="underline">dīxerim</span>! “<span class="underline">May I have spoken</span> with your allowance!”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
			<p>The optative subjunctive is sometimes introduced by ut, quī, or ō sī.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Quī</span> <span class="underline">utinam</span> omnēs ante mē sententiam <span class="underline">rogārentur</span>!</p>
			<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">Would that all were asked</span> their opinion before me!”</p>
