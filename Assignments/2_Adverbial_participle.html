title: Assignment 2 Adverbial Particles and the Ablative Absolute
---

	<h2>Adverbial Participles and the Ablative Absolute</h2>
	<div class="block">
		<p>The majority of participles in Latin, particularly in prose, should be understood to perform an adverbial function. This is to say, they serve to situate or contextualize the action expressed the primary verb in the clause.</p>
		<p>With this in view, many instances of the participle which might first appear to be attributive are best taken adverbially. Platō <span class="underline">scrībēns</span> mortuus est is not best rendered, “Plato, <span class="underline">who was writing</span>, died” but instead, “<span class="underline">While he was writing</span>, Plato died”. Likewise, Rēmus <span class="underline">ictus</span> in turbā cecidit is not best translated, “Remus, <span class="underline">struck</span>, fell in the commotion” but, “Remus <span class="underline">was struck and</span> fell in the commotion.” </p>
						
		<p>The most common types of adverbial participles include: coordinating, circumstantial, temporal, causal, and concessive. The exact force of the participle can only be determined by referencing the broader context in which is found. Even after fully understanding the context, however, sometimes multiple interpretations may seem equally suitable.</p>

		<p>While adverbial participles do not always need to be translated with a separate clause in English, it is a useful way to highlight the adverbial force of the participle. As such, all adverbial participles will be translated as a separate clause in this lesson.</p>

		<p>Like adjectival participles, adverbial participles express a time relative to the primary verb of the clause.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>A participle, often a perfect participle, may be coordinating and express an action which is immediately prior or practically simultaneous to the action of the primary verb in the clause. The coordinating participle is often translated with the conjunction “and”.</p>
			
		<p class="indent">Urbs <span class="underline">condīta</span> nōmine conditōris appellāta est.</p>
				<p class="indent2">“The city <span class="underline">was founded and</span> called by the name of it’s founder.”</p>
			
		<p class="indent">Ab urbe <span class="underline">profectus</span> in citeriōre ripā Aniēnis castra posuit.</p>
				<p class="indent2">“He <span class="underline">set out</span> from the city <span class="underline">and</span> placed his camps on the far bank of the Anio.”</p>

		<p>Sometimes participle with a coordinating will be attached to a word other than the subject. In such instances, the participle is often best translated as an action performed by the subject.</p>

		<p class="indent">Cerēs ad <span class="underline">audītās</span> vōcēs stupuit. “Ceres <span class="underline">heard</span> the words and was astounded at them.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>A participle may be circumstantial, indicating the occasion correllating with or prompting the the action of the primary verb. It may be best translated into English with the conjunctions “while”, “when”, or “once”.</p>

		<p class="indent">Haec <span class="underline">agentī</span> portentum terribile vīsum est.</p>
				<p class="indent2">“A terrible portent appeared to him <span class="underline">while he was doing</span> these things”</p>

		<p class="indent">Nec sōl nec pluviae nivem <span class="underline">iactam</span> resolvunt.</p>		
				<p class="indent2">“Neither the sun nor the rain melts the snow, <span class="underline">once it has fallen</span>.”</p>

		<p class="indent">Ōrātor <span class="underline">irātus</span> aliquandō melior est.</p>
				<p class="indent2">“The orator is sometimes better <span class="underline">when he is upset</span>.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>A participle may be temporal, establishing the time relative to when the action of the primary verb occurs. A present tense temporal participle is usually translated with the conjunctions “when” or “while”.</p>
		<p class="indent">Scīpiō obsidiōnem sine certāmine <span class="underline">adveniēns</span> solvit.</p>
				<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">When</span> Scipio <span class="underline">arrived</span>, he dissolved the seige without a struggle.</p>

		<p>A perfect tense temporal participle is usually translated with the conjunction “after”.</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Repulsī</span> ab equitātū sē in silvās abdidērunt.</p>
				<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">After they were repelled</span> by the cavalry, they hid themselves in the woods.”</p>

		<p>A future tense temporal participle is usually translated with the conjunction “before”.</p>
		<p class="indent">Illōs in peregrīnātiōnem <span class="underline">exitūrī</span> relīquerimus.</p>
				<p class="indent2">“We have often left them behind <span class="underline">before we go</span> on a long journey.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>A participle may be causal, expressing the reason why the action of the primary verb of the clause occurred. Conversely, a participle may be concessive, expressing a reason which might have prevented the action of the primary verb of the clause. A causal participle is usually translated with the conjunctions “because” or “since” whereas a concessive participle is often translated with the conjunction “though” or “although”.</p>

		<p class="indent">Oppidānī <span class="underline">obsessī</span> externa auxilia nōn habēbant.</p>
				<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">Because they were beseiged</span>, the townspeople had no foreign aid.”</p>
		
		<p class="indent">Numquam virtūs sē <span class="underline">contenta</span> vitiō adiuvanda est.</p>
				<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">Since</span> virtue is self-<span class="underline">satisfied</span>, virtue need never be aided by vice.”</p>

		<p class="indent">Eum esse salvum haec <span class="underline">cōnfitentem</span> volunt.</p>
				<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">Although he admits these things</span>, they wish for him to be safe.”</p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Īrātī</span> quīdam sē continent.</p>
				<p class="indent2">“Certain people, <span class="underline">though they have been angered</span>, restrain themselves.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">	
		<p>The term ablative absolute refers to a construction which establishes context by attaching a participle to an ablative noun inserted into the sentence solely as part of this construction. This ablative noun expresses either the performer of the action of an active participle or the recipient of the action of a passive participle. An ablative absolute may express any of the possible contexts expressed by an adverbial participle.</p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Nūllīs prohibentibus</span> in tuā aulā regunt.</p>
				<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">Since none are forbidding</span>, they reign in your court.”</p>
		
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Omnibus impensīs</span> nihil āctum est.</p>
				<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">Although all things have been furnished</span>, nothing has been accomplished.”</p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Tubā audītā</span> mīles ad arma concitāvit.</p>
				<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">After the warhorn was heard</span>, the soldier rushed to his arms.”</p>

		<p>When a present participle functions as an adverbial participle in the ablative singular, the ending is usually -e (ie. dūcente, agente).</p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Paulinā meā retinente</span> exīre persevērāvī.</p>
				<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">Although my Paulina detained me</span>, I insisted on going out.”</p>

		<p>Sometimes an ablative absolute contains an implied participle of the verb sum (which only has a future active participle form). Instead of an ablative noun and participle, the construction contains two ablatives. One ablative is the subject of the implied participle of sum. A second ablative, either a noun or an adjective, is a predicate ablative, and is identical to the predicate nominative or predicate accusative in its function.</p>

		<p class="indent">Magnum frūctum hārum rērum <span class="underline">rē pūblicā salvā</span> tulī.</p>
				<p class="indent2">“I obtained a large reward for these things <span class="underline">while the Republic was unharmed</span>.”</p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Valerio Āsiāticō cōnsule</span> iterum accīdit.</p>
				<p class="indent2">“It happened again <span class="underline">when Valerius Asiaticus was consul</span>.”</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Some additional notes</h2>
	<div class="block">
		<p>An adverbial participle may have a conditional effect when the occurance of the action of the primary verb of the clause is logically dependant on the action of the participle. A conditional participle is best translated into English with the conjunction “if”.</p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Victae</span> cēdite fonte Medūsaeo.</p>
					<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">If defeated</span>, depart from the font of Medusa.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>A future active participle may function adverbially to express purpose.</p>
		<p class="indent">Cornēlius ad castra hostium vēnit nūllam moram dīmicandī <span class="underline">factūrus</span>.</p>
					<p class="indent2">“Cornelius came to the camps of the enemy <span class="underline">in order to make</span> no delay in fighting.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>Participles may be found after verbs of perceiving in place of an indirect statement. This construction expresses the things actually perceived rather than the information gained from the perception.</p>
		<p class="indent">Colōnī vīdērunt vesperā serpentem ē pāstū <span class="underline">redeuntem</span>.</p>
					<p class="indent2">“Farmers have seen a dragon <span class="underline">returning</span> from the pasture at night.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">		
		<p>A noun paired with a participle may sometimes perform the same function otherwise  expressed by a noun clause.</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Classis cōnspecta cōnsulī spem fēcit.</p>
					<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">That the fleet was seen</span> brought about hope for the Consul.”</p>
					<p class="indent2">or “<span class="underline">The sight of the fleet</span> brought about hope for the Consul.”</p>
