title: Assignment 8 Potential subjunctives (outside of conditional statements)
---

	<h2>Potential subjunctives (outside of conditional statements)</h2>
	
	<div class="block">
		<p>The potential subjunctive is most commonly found as part of conditional statements to form contrary-to-fact and less vivid conditionals. This lesson, however, will focus only on the independent use of the potential subjunctive, not its use in conditionals.</p>

		<p>The independent use of the potential subjunctive expresses an action which is possible or was possible (but didn’t occur) in the past. Additionally, the potential is also used in the 1st person singular to express mild assertion and in the expression of wishes (as an alternative to the optative subjunctive).</p>

		<p>The potential subjunctive is negated by nōn.</p>
	</div>			
	<div class="block">
		<p>Present or perfect subjunctive (with no distinction in sense) in any person or number may refer to an action which is either possible or imaginable. Subjunctive verbs of this sort are often translated into English with “may”, “would”, sometimes “could”.</p>
			<p class="indent">Hecatē hoc <span class="underline">nōn</span> <span class="underline">sinat</span>. “Hecate <span class="underline">would</span> <span class="underline">not</span> <span class="underline">permit</span> it.”</p>

			<p>Forsitan (“perhaps”) sometimes accompanies a potential subjunctive (but it is also frequent with the indicative). With forsitan, no added words are needed to indicate potential in English.</p>
			
			<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Forsitan</span> Venus ex tota gente tributa <span class="underline">petat</span>. </p>
			<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">Perhaps</span> Venus <span class="underline">seeks</span> payment by reason of my family.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>The potential subjunctive often has an indefinite subject in the 2nd person (an indefinite or generic “you”)  or 3rd person (“someone”). In the 3rd person, this is often signaled with one of the following indefinite pronouns: aliquis, quispiam, or the indefinite quis (see Lesson 5).</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Nōn</span> facile <span class="underline">inveniās</span> ūnum multīs in mīlibus.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">You could</span> <span class="underline">not</span> easily <span class="underline">find</span> one among thousands.”</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Forsitan</span> quispiam hoc <span class="underline">dīxerit</span>. “<span class="underline">Perhaps</span> anyone <span class="underline">could say</span> this.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
			<p>The imperfect subjunctive may refer to a conceivable or probably action in the past and can be expressed in any person and number. A past conceivable action is best translated into English with “might have”, “would have”, “could have”.</p>
	
			<p class="indent">Haec causa melius ā tribus <span class="underline">agerētur</span> quam nunc ab ūnō agitur. </p>
			<p class="indent2">“This cause <span class="underline">would have been</span> better <span class="underline">plead</span> by three men than now it is plead by one.”</p>
		</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>A 2nd person singular imperfect subjunctive in narration indicates what you (an indefinite or generic “you”) would have seen, thought, or believed, if you had been present at the events described. Sometimes the 3rd person imperfect subjunctive is used in an equivalent sense.</p>

		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Crēderēs</span> dē caelō deōs dēcidere.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">You would have believed</span> that the gods fell from the sky.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>The first person singular present or perfect subjunctive is common in mild assertions expressed with verbs of thinking, speaking, or wishing. This is illustrated in the difference between the statements credo (“I believe”) and velim crēdere or velim crēdam (“I would like to believe”). This use of the potential subjunctive may be translated into English phrases like: “I would like”, “I would say”, “I would think”, etc.</p>

		<p class="indent">Hoc minimum malōrum in illīs <span class="underline">dīxerim</span>. “<span class="underline">I would call</span> this the least of their evils.”</p>
		<p class="indent">Velim tū saepe ad mē <span class="underline">scrībās</span>.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">I would like</span> you to write to me often” or “<span class="underline">I wish</span> you would write to me often.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
			<p>The imperfect forms vellem, nōllem, and māllem (as well as other verbs of wishing, ie. cuperem, optārem) indicate an unfulfilled wish in the present. This use of the potential subjunctive can be translated with phrases such as: “I wish it were” “I wish I could”, “I prefer you would”, etc.</p>
	
			<p class="indent">Nunc <span class="underline">vellem</span> frēnāre dracōnēs Mēdēae. “Now <span class="underline">I wish I could</span> bridle Medea’s dragons.”</p>
			<p class="indent2">or “<span class="underline">Would that I could</span> now bridle Medea’s dragons.”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Nōllem</span>, sed necesse est. “<span class="underline">I wish it weren’t</span>, but it is necessary”</p>
			<p>The formulations are often, but not necessarily, less exclamatory in nature than the optative subjunctive (see Lesson 7). Otherwise, there can be little to no difference between the this use of the potential subjunctive and the unfulfillable wish, as indicated by the alternate translations included above.</p>
		</div>


	<h2>Some additional notes</h2>
	<div class="block">
		<p>Outside of conditionals, the pluperfect subjunctive appears rarely with potential force referring to something which could have happened in the past, but did not.</p>
		<p class="indent">Nūlla pāgina meīs in libellīs sine tē <span class="underline">crēvisset</span>.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“No page in my books <span class="underline">would have grown</span> without you.” </p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
			<p>The potential subjunctive with an indefinite subject may occur in interrogative statements, and in such cases are little different from the deliberative use of the jussive subjunctive (except that the subject is indefinite).</p>
			<p class="indent">Quis sōlem dīcere falsum <span class="underline">Who would dare</span>audeat? “ to call the sun deceitful?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Quis iniūriam Catōnī sciēns <span class="underline">faceret</span>? “<span class="underline">Who could have</span> knowingly <span class="underline">done</span> injury to Cato?”</p>
