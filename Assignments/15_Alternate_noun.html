---

	<h2>Alternate and peculiar forms in nouns and adjectives</h2>
	
	<div class="block">
		<p>Latin contains a variety of alternate and peculiar forms of nouns and adjectives. This section will offer a brief overview of many alternate and original forms which are commonly found while reading Latin.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>2nd declension nouns ending in -ius or -ium in the nominative often have the ending -ī not -iī in the genitive singular only. These include the forms: fīlī (from fīlius), cōnsilī (from cōnsilium), Claudī (from Claudius), etc.</p>
		<p class="indent">Minae <span class="underline">Clōdī</span> modicē mē tangunt. “<span class="underline">Clodius’</span> threats affect me little.”</p>
		<p class="indent">Tam eram rudis, tam ignārus rērum, tam expers <span class="underline">cōnsilī</span> aut <span class="underline">ingenī</span>?</p>
		<p class="indent2">“Was I so foolish, so ignorant of affairs, so devoid <span class="underline">of judgment</span> or <span class="underline">intellect</span>?”</p>
		<p>Additionally, proper names ending in -ius and also the noun fīlius have the regular vocative singular ending -ī not -ie. These vocative singular forms include: fīlī, Lucilī, Hortensī, Memmī, etc.</p>
		<p class="indent">Voluī, <span class="underline">fīlī</span>, satisne scīrēs cōnsulem tē esse.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“I wanted to know, <span class="underline">son</span>, if you were quite aware that you are consul.”</p>
		<p>Likewise, the possessive adjective meus declines as mī in the vocative masculine singular (see also Assignment 16).</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>The genitive plural ending -ōrum sometimes has the alternate ending -um, especially in poetry. This alternate genitive plural ending is identical to the accusative singular, and so correct identification depends on context. Common examples of this form include the genitive plural forms: virum (in place of virōrum), superum (in place of superōrum), deum (in place of deōrum), dīvum (in place of dīvōrum), līberum (in place of līberōrum), equum (in place of equōrum) and socium (in place of sociōrum).</p>
		<p class="indent">Sēcutus <span class="underline">deum</span> praecepta hinc vēnī.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“I, after following the commands <span class="underline">of the gods</span>, have arrived at this place.”</p>
		<p class="indent">Multī in iūdicandō peccāta <span class="underline">līberum</span> parentum misericordiae concessērunt.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“Many have forgiven the sins <span class="underline">of children</span> in casting judgment out of pity for their parents.”</p>
		<p>Additionally, the noun deus has several peculiar forms. In the singular, deus does not appear in the vocative singular. In the plural, the nominative and vocative plural may appear as deī, dī or diī, the genitive plural may be deōrum or deum (as noted above), the dative and ablative plural may be deīs, diīs, or dīs.</p>
		<p class="indent">Agite <span class="underline">dīs</span> immortālibus grātiās! “Give thanks <span class="underline">to the</span> immortal <span class="underline">gods</span>!”</p>
		<p class="indent">Hōc meruī; magnī <span class="underline">deī</span> sīc voluērunt.	“I have earned this; the great <span class="underline">gods</span> have will it so.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>Many 3rd declension nouns (those classed as i-stems and those classed as mixed i-stems) and most 3rd declension adjectives may be found with the ending -īs in place of -ēs in the accusative plural.</p>
		<p class="indent">Nōnne vīdērunt moenia Troiae cōnsīdere in <span class="underline">ignīs</span>?</p>
		<p class="indent2">“Did they not see the walls of Troy descend into <span class="underline">flames</span>?”</p>
		<p class="indent">Vester honōs mē intentīs oculīs <span class="underline">omnīs</span> reī pūblicae <span class="underline">partīs</span> intuērī iubet.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“Your honor bids me to watch over <span class="underline">every</span> <span class="underline">part</span> of the Republic with attentive eyes.”</p>
		<p>Some 3rd declension nouns (those classed as i-stems) may have either -ī or -e in the ablative singular.</p>
		<p class="indent">Sīgēa frēta lāta <span class="underline">ignī</span> relūcent. “The broad Sigean straights gleamed <span class="underline">with fire</span>.”</p>
		<p class="indent">Althaea flagrantem rāmum ab <span class="underline">igne</span> ēripuit.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“Althaea snatched the burning branch from out of <span class="underline">the fire</span>.”</p>
		<p>3r declension adjectives usually  have -ī (but a few may have -e) in the ablative singular.</p>
		<p class="indent">Haud <span class="underline">tālī</span> honōre mē dignor. “In no way do I deem myself worthy of <span class="underline">so great</span> an honor.”</p>
		<p>Some third declension nouns (those classed as i-stems) may have the ending -im instead of -em in the accusative singular. For a number of nouns, the accusative singular ending in -im is the sole extant form, including: sitim, tussim, Tiberim. Other such nouns may be found ending in either em or im, including: nāvem/nāvim, securem/secūrim, turrem/turrim, febrem/febrim.</p>
		<p class="indent">Vīnō cūrāsque <span class="underline">sitim</span>que levant. “They lighten their cares and <span class="underline">thirst</span> with wine”</p>
		<p class="indent">Cōgitō interdum trāns <span class="underline">Tiberim</span> hortōs aliquōs parāre.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“I occasionally consider obtaining some gardens across <span class="underline">the Tiber</span>.”</p>
		<p>The i-stem noun vīs is found regularly only in three forms in the singular: nominative (vīs), ablative (vī), and accusative (vim). It is common in all cases in the plural, and the plural forms are all declined based upon the stem vīr-. The forms vīrēs and vīrīs are both found in the accusative plural.</p>
		<p>In both the singular and plural, this noun can mean “force”, “strength”, “power”, “vigor”, etc..</p>
		<p class="indent">Thrēicius rēx Polydōrum obtruncat et aurō <span class="underline">vī</span> potītur.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“The Thracian king kills Polydorus and takes possession of his gold <span class="underline">by force</span>.”</p>
		<p class="indent">Cape hunc equum, dum tibi <span class="underline">vīrium</span> aliquid superest.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“Take this horse, while some amount <span class="underline">of vigor</span> remains for you.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>Certain fourth declension nouns have both the endings -ibus and -ubus in the dative and ablative plural, including specus (specibus or specubus), portus (portibus or portubus). The ending is -ubus is regular in select nouns, including: tribus, sūs, and artus.</p>
		<p class="indent">Scythiae gentēs in defossīs <span class="underline">specubus</span> sub altā terrā otia agunt.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“The people of Scythia spend their leisure in hollowed out <span class="underline">caves</span> under the deep earth.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>The phrase pater familiās (literally, “father of the family”), which is sometimes printed as paterfamiliās, contains the archaic genitive form familiās. This term is usually left simply as “pater familias” when translating into English. Even when printed as a compound, pater declines while familiās is fixed in the genitive. Sometimes the form pater familae is used instead and the plural is may appear as either patrēs familiās or patrēs familiārum.</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Pater familiās</span>, ubi ad vīllam venit, fundum circumeat, sī potest.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“<span class="underline">The pater familias</span>, when he visits his villa, should go all around his estate, if he is able.”</p>
		<p>The terms māter/fīlius/fīlia familiās are also used.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h2>Some additional notes</h2>
	<div class="block">
		<p>For individual overviews of i-stem endings, consult the following references: -im in the accusative (see Allen and Greenough <a href="http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/latin/3rd-declension-summary-i-stem-forms" target="_blank">§75</a>), -ī in the ablative (see Allen and Greenough <a href="http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/latin/3rd-declension-pure-i-stem-n" target="_blank">§68</a> & <a href="http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/latin/3rd-declension-summary-i-stem-forms" target="_blank">§76</a>), -īs in the nominative (see Allen and Greenough <a href="http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/latin/3rd-declension-summary-i-stem-forms" target="_blank">§77</a>), -um instead of -ium in the genitive (see Allen and Greenough <a href="http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/latin/3rd-declension-summary-i-stem-forms" target="_blank">§78</a>).</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
	<p>For the use of ablative singular endings -ī and -e in participles, see Assignments 1 & 2.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>The genitive plural ending in -um in place of -ōrum the 2nd declension is also common in many terms of measure and money (see Allen and Greenough <a href="http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/latin/2nd-declension-case-forms" target="_blank">§49d</a>).</p>
		<p class="indent">Nerō bīna <span class="underline">nummum</span> mīlia virītim manipulāribus dīvīsit.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“Nero handed out two-thousand <span class="underline">sesterces</span> a man to the soldiers.”</p>
		<p class="indent2">“(literally, “Nero handed out two-thousand <span class="underline">of sesterces</span> a man to the soldiers.”)</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>3rd declension nouns ending in -or have the original ending -ōs which is still found in some texts and authors. Hence we sometimes find the forms honōs (rather than honor), arbōs (rather than arbor), labōs (rather than labor), etc.</p>
		<p class="indent">Tē iam ferre Herculī <span class="underline">labōs</span> est. “It is already a Herculean <span class="underline">labor</span> to put up with you.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>In many 2nd declension nouns and adjectives in which then stem ends in -u or -v (ie. servus, equus, antīquus, novus, tuus, etc.), the ending -os is sometimes found in place of -us and -om in place of -um (in both the masculine and neuter). These include the forms servos (in addition to servus), antīquom (in addition to antīquum), etc.</p>
		<p class="indent">Tibi ego an tu mihi <span class="underline">servos</span> es? “Am I your <span class="underline">slave</span> or are you mine?”</p>
		<p class="indent"><span class="underline">Antīquom</span> poētam audīvī scrīpsisse mulierēs duās peiōrēs esse quam ūnam.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“I have heard that an <span class="underline">ancient</span> poet wrote that two women are worse than one.”</p>
		<p>In the same class of words (nouns and adjectives with a stem ending in -u or -v), the genitive plural ending -um sometimes appears as -om.</p>
		<p class="indent">Ārdor fulminis <span class="underline">dīvōm</span> simulacra perēmit.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“The blaze of thunderbolt destroys the statues <span class="underline">of the gods</span>.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>3rd declension nouns ending in -or have the original ending -ōs which is still found in some texts and authors. Hence we sometimes find the forms honōs (rather than honor), arbōs (rather than arbor), labōs (rather than labor), etc.</p>
		<p class="indent">Tē iam ferre Herculī <span class="underline">labōs</span> est. “It is already a Herculean <span class="underline">labor</span> to put up with you.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>The ablative and dative plural forms for fīlia and dea are regularly fīliābus and deābus, distinguishing these forms from their masculine counterparts. This same ending is also found in the declension of duo (duābus).</p>
		<p class="indent">Hēraclīa ad penātēs cōnfūgit cum duābus <span class="underline">fīliābus</span> virginibus.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“Heraclia fled to the household gods with her two unwed <span class="underline">daughters</span>.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>The noun bōs has forms based upon the stem bov- (ie. bovis, bovem, bovēs, etc.) but the v in the stem has been lost in the forms: bōs, boum, and bōbus. Bōs also has both bōbus and būbus in the dative and ablative plural.</p>
		<p class="indent">Ūna <span class="underline">boum</span> vōcem reddidit vastōque sub antrō mūgīvit.</p>
		<p class="indent2">“One <span class="underline">of the cows</span> answered and bellowed below the vast cavern.”</p>
