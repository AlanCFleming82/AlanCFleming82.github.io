	The Workbook of Latin Grammar aims to introduce readers to intermediate and
	advanced concepts from Latin grammar, with strong emphasis on actual usage by
	Roman authors. Each lesson contains numerous full sentence examples which illustrate
	grammar concepts otherwise disparately represented in actual reading. A combination
	of short-answer exercises and full-sentence translation exercises are used to reinforce
	the material covered in each lesson. Through a combination of grammatical explanation and 
	varied exercises, this workbook offers a thorough and active engagement with topics from 
	Latin grammar which generally receive only a summary treatment in introductory textbooks.
</p>
<p>Each lesson includes the following components:</p>
<ul class="preface">
	<li>
		An exposition on a topic from Latin grammar (including a section of optional
		notes not required for completing exercises).
	</li>
	<li>20-40 short-answer exercises.</li>
	<li>10 simple sentence translation exercises.</li>
	<li>
		15 more complex example sentences or passages for translation, each
		presented with a brief contextual introduction and some notes on grammar and
		vocabulary. These modified examples are derived solely from the works of
		Cicero, Caesar, Livy, Vergil, Ovid and the prose works of the younger Seneca.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	In sum, this workbook contains 10 lesson and a total of 575 exercises including 150
	sentences presented with a brief contextual introduction and grammatical notes. The assignments are each self-contained and may be completed in any order. All
	exercises are presented without an answer key to preserve their integrity for use in
	instruction.
</p>
<p>
	Nearly all of the Latin presented (including English-to-Latin exercises) is derivative of
	actual Latin texts, primarily drawn from works of Cicero, Caesar, Livy, Vergil, Ovid and
	the younger Seneca. These examples have been simplified from their original context in
	order to provide straightforward, full-sentence examples for a range of grammatical
	topics.
</p>
<p>
	My representation of grammatical concepts is based heavily on information gleaned
	from existing Latin grammars. In particular, I have relied on Allen and Greenoughâ€™s New
	Latin Grammar, the New Latin Grammar by Charles E. Bennett, and A New Latin
	Syntax, by E. C. Woodcock. While these works are rarely cited within the body of this
	workbook, they bear a perpetual influence on my understanding, description, and
	representation of these topics. These grammars, and other works which have been
	consulted, are listed on the references page.
